# IOIS_Simulation
 
This project is developed during my Master Thesis "Interorganizational Information Systems in Supply Chain Triads: An Agent-Based Simulation Model". The model uses parts of the MESA package. In this model, a triadic supply chain is modeled by allowing the opportunities to flow from one supply-chain tier to the next.

The code is optimized to run multiple experiemts using multiprocessing.
